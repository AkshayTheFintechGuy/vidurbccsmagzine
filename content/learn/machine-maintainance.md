## 🏭 What is Machine Maintenance?

**Machine maintenance** refers to the processes, actions, and checks performed to keep machines in optimal working condition.  
It includes:
- Cleaning and inspection  
- Lubrication and calibration  
- Replacing worn-out parts  
- Monitoring equipment performance  

This systematic approach ensures equipment runs reliably and continues to produce quality output.

### 1. **Preventive Maintenance (PM)**
Scheduled checks and servicing to avoid breakdowns.  
🗓 Example: Changing filters or oil every 500 machine hours.

### 2. **Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**
Uses sensors and data analytics to detect early signs of failure.  
📊 Example: Using vibration or temperature data to predict bearing wear.

### 3. **Corrective Maintenance**
Performed after a breakdown occurs.  
⚠️ Example: Replacing a failed motor or gearbox.

### 4. **Condition-Based Maintenance**
Triggered by real-time monitoring of specific machine conditions.  
🔍 Example: Maintenance alerts when temperature crosses a defined limit.
