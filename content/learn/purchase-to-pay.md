The **Purchase to Pay (P2P)** process — also known as **Procure to Pay** — is the lifecycle that organizations use to acquire goods and services and make payments to suppliers.  
It connects **procurement**, **inventory**, **finance**, and **compliance** into one seamless workflow.

This process is crucial for ensuring:
✅ Right materials  
✅ At the right price  
✅ From the right vendors  
✅ Delivered at the right time

### 1️⃣ Purchase Requisition 📝  
An internal department requests goods/services.  
Includes:
- Required quantity
- Specifications
- Urgency / due date
- Budget approval

### 2️⃣ Vendor Selection & Purchase Order (PO) 📑  
Approved request becomes a PO which is sent to the supplier.  
The PO serves as a **legal contract** confirming:
- Item description
- Price & terms
- Delivery schedule

### 3️⃣ Goods Receipt & Inspection 📦  
The supplier ships goods.  
Warehouse verifies:
- Quantities received
- Quality checks  
- Records partial or full receipt

This stage updates **inventory levels** ✅.

### 4️⃣ Invoice Receipt & Matching 🧾  
Supplier sends an invoice.  
System performs a **3-way match**:
| PO | Goods Receipt | Invoice |
|---|---|---|
| Quantity | Quantity | Quantity |
| Price | — | Price |

If mismatch → Exception Handling 🚫  
If matched → Approved ✅

### 5️⃣ Vendor Payment 💳  
Finance schedules and releases payment via:
- Bank transfer
- Check
- Integrated payment platforms

Payment updates **Accounts Payable** and closes the transaction.
